/**
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
 * <p>
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
 * -109 <= Node.val <= 109
 * All Node.val are unique.
 * p != q
 * p and q will exist in the BST.
