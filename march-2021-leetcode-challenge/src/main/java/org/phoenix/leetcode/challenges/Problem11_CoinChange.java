/**
 * You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to
 * compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be
 * made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
 * <p>
 * You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= coins.length <= 12
 * 1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1
 * 0 <= amount <= 104
