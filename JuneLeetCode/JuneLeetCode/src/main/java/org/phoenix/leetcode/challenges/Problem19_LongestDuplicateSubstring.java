/*
 * Given a string S, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or
 * more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)
 * Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.
 * (If S does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "".)
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: "banana"
 * Output: "ana"
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: "abcd"
 * Output: ""
 *
 * Note:
 * 2 <= S.length <= 10^5
 * S consists of lowercase English letters.

    /*A trie is a discrete data structure that's not quite well-known or widely-mentioned in typical algorithm courses,
        but nevertheless an important one.

    A trie (also known as a digital tree) and sometimes even radix tree or prefix tree (as they can be searched by prefixes)
    , is an ordered tree structure, which takes advantage of the keys that it stores â€“ usually strings.

    A node's position in the tree defines the key with which that node is associated,
    which makes tries different in comparison to binary search trees, in which a node stores a key that corresponds only to that node.

    In a trie, every node (except the root node) stores one character or a digit.
    By traversing the trie down from the root node to a particular node n, a common prefix of characters or
    digits can be formed which is shared by other branches of the trie as well.
