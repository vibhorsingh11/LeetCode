/**
 * You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array
 * nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.
 * <p>
 * If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of
 * bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.
 * <p>
 * Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * n == nums.length
 * 1 <= n <= 500
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 100
