 * You are given an array representing a row of seats where seats[i] = 1 represents a person sitting in the ith seat, and seats[i] = 0 represents that the ith seat is empty (0-indexed).
 * <p>
 * There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.
 * <p>
 * Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized.
 * <p>
 * Return that maximum distance to the closest person.
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 2 <= seats.length <= 2 * 104
 * seats[i] is 0 or 1.
 * At least one seat is empty.
 * At least one seat is occupied.
